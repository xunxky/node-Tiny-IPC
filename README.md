# node-Tiny-IPC
===============
## Description
small  and simple IPC for easy clustered Development 

when I required a simple easy direct inter process communication 
within my clustered node server, I had to realize, 
that there are no simple IPCs available 

therfore I have written a fairly simple version.  
probably it wont be very resilient and shouldnt be used after all ;)

## Usage

```js
	var CPUs = require('os').cpus().length,
		cluster = require('cluster'),
		IPC=require('tiny-ipc');


	if (cluster.isMaster ) {
		var hub = IPC.makeHub('/tmp/mysock1');
		for (var i = 0; i < CPUs; i++) { //
			cluster.fork();
		}   
	} else {
		c = IPC.getClient('/tmp/mysock1');
		c.on('message',function(o){console.log(o);});
		c.broadcastMessage (' test '+process.pid);
	}
```
